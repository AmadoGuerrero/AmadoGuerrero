### Welcome to the Real World

I have been coding since I was 12 (started off with Vanilla JS back in 2005), and I wanted to be a hacker when I was younger (I blame The Matrix)

I'm a backend engineer with a solid background in AWS, TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. Right now I'm building large-scale systems at a media company, but my path into software started way before that. I used to be a licensed home inspector, which taught me how to think in systems and spot problems before they blow up. Professionally, most of my work has been around APIs and cloud stuff, but I'm also really into low-level engineering and reverse engineering. I’ve spent a lot of time digging into how binaries work, playing with ROP chains, code caves, and debugging weird behavior in drivers on Linux. It’s not just surface-level curiosity, I’ve taken apart real software just to see how it ticks. That kind of work doesn’t show up on my resume, but it's a big part of how I think and what I want to do more of.
